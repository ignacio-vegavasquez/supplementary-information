# supplementary-information
Repository created to upload supplementary information.

March, 2023 Update:

Currently, this repository only contains two semi-automatized scripts: 
  1) One for  F/F0 calculation, created for use in calcium imaging
  2) One for linear bleaching correction, also created for use in calcium imaging

An example folder is uploaded as a .rar file, and both codes are self-explanatory as
they are sufficiently commented. They are not limited to calcium signaling analysis,
but they were created considerating that data as an input.

Both codes were used in the analysis of data in:

-Lobos, P., Córdova, A., Vega-Vásquez, I., Ramírez, O. A., Adasme, T., Toledo, J., ... & Hidalgo, C. (2021). RyR-mediated Ca2+ release elicited by neuronal activity induces nuclear Ca2+ signals, CREB phosphorylation, and Npas4/RyR2 expression. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118(33), e2102265118.

-Gleitze, S., Ramírez, O. A., Vega-Vásquez, I., Yan, J., Lobos, P., Bading, H., ... & Hidalgo, C. (2023). Ryanodine Receptor Mediated Calcium Release Contributes to Ferroptosis Induced in Primary Hippocampal Neurons by GPX4 Inhibition. Antioxidants, 12(3), 705.
